# Image-based-spatiotemporal-rockfall-hazard
 Assessment of rockfall failure hazard from a photomonitoring-derived rockfall inventory of the Poggio Baldi landslide rock slope.

## Project Overview

 This repository contains the analysis of a photomonitoring-derived rockfall inventory of the Poggio Baldi rock slope. The project aims to discover the spatiotemporal distribution of rockfall events to derive the failure hazard by using cumulative frequency-magnitude relations and power-law fitting.

## Objectives

1. Analyze rockfall events in both space and time to derive rock slope failure hazard equations in both space and time.

## Poggio Baldi Landslide

The Poggio Baldi landslide, located within the Municipality of Santa Sofia in the Emilia Romagna region of Italy, proximate to the village of Corniolo, represents a significant slope instabilities within the Central Apennines, a trust and fold orogenic belt verging N-E and oriented approximately WNW-ESE (McKenzie, 1972).

### Geological Setting

The landslide extends from an elevation of 845 m asl at its primary scarp to 467 m asl where it intersects with the Bidente River and the National Road SS310. The Bidente River valley exposes the Marnoso-Arenacea Formation (FMA), a flysch formation comprising alternating layers of marls and sandstones from the Miocene age (Benini et al., 1992; Martelli et al., 2002; Ricci Lucchi, 1981). This formation consists of feldspathic and lithic pelitic-arenaceous turbidites of Alpine origin and subordinately carbonate of Apennine origin.

The sequence outcropping at Poggio Baldi belongs to the Corniolo Member of the FMA. The thickness of the bedding strata varies from few centimetres to multiple meters. Sandstone beds are typically thicker than pelitic layers, which are also considerably weaker, thus resulting in differential erosion leading to the formation of overhanging sandstone layer geometries.

### Landslide History

Historical landslide activations date back to March 1914 and March 2010. The former was a large-scale wedge failure, while the latter involved the previous landslide's body mobilizing approximately 4 Ã— 10^6 cubic meters of material. The failure was triggered by increased pore water pressure after rapid snowmelt, destroying several buildings, uprooting the national road, and impeding the Bidente River, leading to the formation of a lake (Benini et al., 2012; Mazzanti et al., 2017).

Mitigation measures were implemented, including the construction of drainage systems within the landslide body and the installation of weirs along the river's course. Nevertheless, ongoing activity persists within the upper scarp of the naturally cut slope, characterised by geomorphic instability and recurrent rockfalls (Mazzanti et al., 2021; Robiati et al., 2023; Romeo et al., 2021).

### Study Focus

This study aims to investigate the rockfall failure hazard posed by the sub-vertical rock wall, focusing on the different rockfall production of two sedimentary intervals outcropping along the slope: PML (Pelitic-Marly Layers), and PA (Pelitic-Arenaceous layers) (Fig. 2).
